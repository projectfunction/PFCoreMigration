		"content": "Throughout this time, we feel we have somewhat enriched the local tech community, bringing opportunities and reach to those who would normally be excluded, all by providing guilt-free and commitment-free access to tech workshops and courses. Best of all, the hard work paid off, some students ended up pivoting into tech, while others gained clarity on how tech can improve their field of work and future career choices.\n\nThis bitter-sweet post will be the last from ProjectFunction as you know it. It outlines how we got here, why the temporary preservation is necessary, and most importantly what it means for the community going forward.\n\nFrom the start, we never intended for ProjectFunction to be a conveyor into tech - this already existed in many forms; all we hoped was to widen the gap and provide a transitionary step between self-learning and committing to bootcamps. We have achieved this goal.\n\n<figure><img style=\"height: auto\" src=\"/public/core/images/notes/unidays.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Wave 1 of ProjectFunction at Unidays</figcaption></figure>\n\nBack in 2018, when we co-founded ProjectFunction, we had one thing in mind; make the tech industry more accessible and welcoming to newcomers, and provide support for them to get into tech. We hyper-focused on changing the landscape at a grassroots level. Back then we were still at university and the workload was bearable. Before too long we started to burn out; our constant drive and devotion to the vision made focusing on our wellbeing, tricky. \n\n\n#### Burning out\n\nFrom the start, the community have been absolutely amazing, backing our work and offering their support - this was great to see. We even had a strong backing from a local agency in Nottingham called [JH](https://wearejh.com), who saw the value of ProjectFunction. But 3 years later, after juggling university, avoiding COVID, and eventually getting a job, the pressure had become apparent. The motivation and momentum we once had was fading - not because we no longer cared, but because we had put our all in it non-stop, for so long, without any breaks or renumeration. We ended up learning something valuable: free labour, no matter how much you love the work, is still free labour. And ultimately, we were working a full time job while working on ProjectFunction; leaving very little in terms of self care and compensation.\n\nBy focusing so much on the growth of ProjectFunction, we ultimately ended up spending a lot less on our own individual growth üòî\n\n\n#### Covid-19 Contingency plan\n\nDuring COVID, we were unable to run in-person courses. This became an issue as it meant potential learners were not getting the benefits that come with ProjectFunction courses. We looked at alternative ways to provide these, but ultimately decided that we wouldn‚Äôt run full courses remotely for 3 reasons:\n\n1. Not everyone has access to computers, stable internet, etc. Especially when we looked at the stats from previous in-person courses (many were borrowing laptops from university or us), and so these people would be at a disadvantage\n2. Our courses typically ran for 9 weeks, at 2hours per week. When in person, it is easier to stimulate and engage with learners, but remotely, we would be fighting zoom fatigue and potential discontent due to lag.\n3. Our instructors would not be able to efficiently provide 1-2-1 help the way we can when going from table to table in person. This would make our courses no different to online learning platforms or YouTube videos. This would also make it harder for us to measure the successes of every session.\n\nOnce these were identified, we started trialing workshops and nano-courses. These were somewhat useful to learners, but ultimately meant instructors (who already weren‚Äôt getting paid), were now spending a lot of time planning and preparing for workshops and then running very short-lived sessions. Even though the feedback was as good as can be expected from zoom workshops, it was burning our instructors out. So we ended up cancelling future workshops and went into hibernation mode. During this time, some of the instructors started providing free 1-2-1 mentoring instead as a way to still provide a service where we could.\n\nAs the situation with the handling of COVID changed, we decided to revisit in-person courses, and successfully ran what would be our final wave. This was a huge undertaking, but thanks to everyone involved, it paid off. But off the back of this success, it also became clear that it was time to retire ProjectFunction in its current form. Continuing to push against this and the upcoming change in [logistics](https://darylcecile.net/notes/moving-out-notts) would put the effectiveness of our goals at risk.\n\n\n#### What this **doesn‚Äôt** mean\n\nNo doubt, all of this, is a significant change in our lives and, more widely, in the Nottingham tech community. While we won‚Äôt be counting down days to our next course or finding learners to join us, we want to be extra clear about what remains unaffected.\n\n- **This situation does not mean we‚Äôll stop caring for the reasons we originally started PF**. Tech has a long way to go until those under-represented and marginalized are not sidelined. We‚Äôll keep working to move the needle forward through every part of our lives that extend beyond PF; supporting, knowledge-sharing, and echoing opportunities wherever we can.\n- **We‚Äôre not putting an end to brainstorming ideas and endeavours to bring more inclusivity and talent to the tech industry**. Who knows, down the line PF may make a comeback like your favourite, long-lost boyband. üòâ\n\n\n#### What it **does** mean going forward\n\nWe‚Äôre believers in the fact that even a small, seemingly insignificant encounter has capacity to completely change someone‚Äôs life for the better. The impact that PF has had on the local tech community will continue to live on through the people we‚Äôve met, inspired, supported, and mentored along the way (this is not unalike the influence the tech community has had on us in return!).\n\nBy this principle, downscaling PF still means that we‚Äôre succeeding in ways we didn‚Äôt expect. Readjusting our focus to take into consideration our own career goals and aspirations contributes towards the PF mission of helping those under-represented and marginalised in tech. After all, we too, fit the target audience that PF had been created for from the start. We‚Äôre still so early in our growth as technologists that we‚Äôve merely just scratched the surface! ‚ÄúYou can't pour from an empty up‚Äù reinforces why it is important we give time to plotting our individual journeys, ahead.\n\nWe are aware that the downscaling of ProjectFunction will have an impact on the community; before us, there was already a shortage in projects that provide guided, zero-commitment access to tech - this has not changed too much due to the landscape and Covid; and our departure will leave a gap in this market. Over the years, we‚Äôve created a number of beginner-friendly resources that covered basic programming concepts and web development in particular. These lesson plans and worksheets have been used by ourselves and other PF instructors to deliver sessions that were interactive, fun, and factored in the rapidly changing tech landscape. Without future sessions planned, it would be remiss for this content to stay locked away. This is why we‚Äôre looking to open-source some of these resources, making them accessible for anyone from anywhere.\n\n \n\n<figure><img style=\"height: auto\" src=\"/public/core/images/notes/nonsuch.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Wave 9 of ProjectFunction at Nonsuch</figcaption></figure>\n\n#### The Impact, and Our hopes for the future\n\nIt is worth iterating that the end of this chapter is proof that ProjectFunction has succeeded - in ways which we never could have expected; we were able to provide opportunities to many eager learners, giving them an insight into the community, guiding as they made a career change to tech, and supporting those who needed it most. We were opportunity providers: An entry into the industry for minorities, by minorities. Throughout the course of running the project, we:\n\n- Learned what its like to fundraise\n- Developed our marketing skills\n- Upped our design game\n- Introduced over 90 Learners to web engineering\n- Launched a successful access program to provide devices and paid learning tools to learners, for free\n- Partnered up with University to provide on-campus education to first-year students\n- Helped students realise they could have a future career in tech\n- Helped some learners make the career-move to tech\n- Reached beyond Nottingham; impacting learners in Singapore, Iran, Amsterdam, London, Birmingham, and even the US.\n- Grown from a team of 2, to a team of 4\n\nThese wins may be small; but considering these all took place while we were juggling full-time work, managing resources, and preparing and planning future courses, it shows the true strength of not only ProjectFunction, but it‚Äôs instructors, and the Nottingham Tech Community.\n\nWe are hopeful that the tech landscape will continue to change for the better, and with that hope that the access to the industry becomes easier - especially for those who are typically sidelined.\n\nWe hope that more conveyer projects pop-up, improving the access to opportunities for younger generations. We hope to see a boost in engagement with social enterprises like Collaborative Future, who are reshaping recruitment for the better - helping teams, networks and organisations to learn from and recruit individuals outside of their usual bubbles.\n\nFinally, we hope that the community will continue to change, grow, and expand; destroying gates and borders along the way, so anyone can explore tech as an interest and/or potential career - without having to worry about being able to afford it.\n\nThank you once again to our instructors, our backers, our sponsors, and our community <3\n\n<figure><img style=\"height: auto\" src=\"/public/core/images/notes/pf-final.jpeg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Team picture: Mary, Daryl, Riz, and Sam</figcaption></figure>",

PF courses offer a zero-commitment, group-based learning opportunity that are unique in offering.\n\nOver the past year, we‚Äôve also come to realise that given our team capacity and the quality we strive to reach with our courses, recreating the relaxed and encouraging environment that our learners have come to expect, in an all-remote setting, is quite the challenge. This challenge is especially heightened when trying to avoid Zoom fatigue and making sure no learner is at a disadvantage due to lack of access to a laptop or the internet.\n\nThus, we will be returning to our PF-standard, in-person courses safely and responsibly, with full Covid-19 precautions in mind.\n\n**Anniversary Special**\n\nTo celebrate ProjectFunction turning 3(!), a bursary of ¬£180<sup>[[1]](https://pfcampus.dev/paccess/docs/3O2fDRP29EGQ)</sup> will be made available to learners upon successful completion of this course (all thanks to the on-going support of our [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/projectfunction)!)\n\nWhat‚Äôs more: we're also starting a referral scheme.\n\nToni Morrison captures best the need for empowering others in her quote: *\"When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else.‚Äù*\n\nWhen you refer someone, you are *choosing* to lift as you climb! Our referral scheme is designed to celebrate this act by offering referees of successful learners to choose between winning a mystery prize or contributing it back to support PF in its mission.\n\nLearners can include a contact detail to their referees when they signup. We will follow-up with all referees of successful learners once the course has ended with more details.\n\n[You can signup today!](https://projectfunction.io/courses/wdb22022ts40)\n",

This is always a special day that is filled with feelings of gratitude and achievement coupled with the reignited drive to change and do better.\n\n<figure>\n            <img src=\"/public/core/images/notes/pf_iwd_2021.png\" alt=\"Illustration of three BAME women made by Emma\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>Happy International Women's Day!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAt ProjectFunction, we wanted to mark the occasion with doing something special. Previously, like many others, we have voiced our support and celebrated women ‚Äî particularly the pioneers in the Technology industry ‚Äî whilst also calling out the stark lack of inclusion of women (especially Black and WoC) in this very same Technology industry even in the 21st century. All that we do at ProjectFunction is shaped to reduce and hopefully, some day, eradicate this inequality; that is our work on a daily basis. \n\nThen, you can understand the struggle we faced in finding a way to voice our celebration on this specific day, how to action our support? Tweeting was, of course, a simple answer. But, we didn‚Äôt just want to Tweet. In our minds, we were conscious that even as a small organisation, we were in possession of some privilege and funds, and tweeting on its own felt like an underutilization of these powers.\n\nSeparately, we‚Äôve been having conversations internally about our marketing assets and how we were missing an element of a ‚Äòhuman touch‚Äô, especially in how we communicated our mission. With both these thoughts colliding, we found our answer in the form of illustrations.\n\nAcross many industries, women‚Äôs efforts and skills are often undervalued and underappreciated. However, we believe that valuing women‚Äôs contribution is long overdue and should be part of an ongoing conversation, not just for International Women's Day but beyond. \n\nWe commissioned [Emma](https://twitter.com/TakeThePeepo), a wonderful, local artist, for an illustration showcasing three wonderful women. Her illustrations helped us add that ‚Äòhuman touch‚Äô our assets were missing, and strengthened our message; allowing us to highlight the importance of valuing and celebrating her skills. No individual alone can resolve the inequalities faced by women in one day, but you sure can make someone's day!\n\nWe pledge to carry on this tradition of having the most impact we can, with the resources we have in the years to come. Of course, we would not be able to do this without the support of our Patreons, Sponsors, and Partners, so a shoutout to _[all](/impact/sponsor)_ of them. Finally, we would like to thank Emma for agreeing to be a part of this for this very special day.",

And as the dust settles on the beginning of the new year a lot of us have vowed to change ourselves in some way, or sworn that we‚Äôre going to learn a new skill, and that‚Äôs something I have a lot of respect for, so if you‚Äôll hear me out, I‚Äôd like to tell you about a little something that I‚Äôve got in the works as part of ProjectFunction, an organisation focused on getting people from marginalised backgrounds into the Tech industry!\n\nSo, let me tell you all about it! First off, you might be thinking: ‚ÄúWho is this guy?‚Äù and that‚Äôs an excellent question. I‚Äôm Jamie! I currently work as a Front End Web Developer, and I love my job, but my background has mostly been in the good old field of Game Makin‚Äô. As such, as we‚Äôre putting the finishing touches on the brand spankin‚Äô new short course on that very topic, I‚Äôd like to take a moment to take you through what you might expect should you find yourself so inclined to come along with me on this little adventure!\n\nFirst off, as much as it pains me to tell you, we won‚Äôt be making the next Assassin‚Äôs Creed, but we will be making something a lot more prolific! Something akin to the Old Days of Yore when our days were spent on MiniClip and CoolMathsGames, and there would be a plethora of flash games to choose from. Well, we‚Äôre adding to that plethora! This course will take you through all of the stages of making a 2D Platformer game using the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/). \n\n‚ÄúThat sounds great, but where do I start, what do I need?‚Äù I hear you ask, well, I‚Äôm delighted to tell you that all you‚Äôll need is a computer and the latest version of the Unity Game Engine. I also recommend finding your favourite [Text Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but fear not, as Unity comes packaged with it‚Äôs own text editor to get you started on the right foot. We‚Äôll be creating a copy of one of the Oldest and Goldest: The Original Donkey Kong, but with a PF Flourish and a couple of extra bells and whistles. Throughout the game making process, you might find yourself writing a variable that makes barrels get spat out at the player faster than a weather broadcaster can pronounce llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch or press the spacebar only to find that your character gets launched into the stratosphere, but that‚Äôs all part of the fun, and part of the learning process of what goes into making a product that you can show off with pride!\n\nGame making can be deceptively hard, but it can also be one of the most rewarding sectors of the industry when everything goes right. It‚Äôs one of those magical eureka moments when you get a particularly cool, but difficult mechanic working that makes you go from this:\n\n<figure style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content:center; background: var(--lm-white0-black1); border-radius: 3px; padding: 12px\"><img src=\"/public/core/images/notes/game-dev-insider-1.png\" alt=\"Jamie with his head down in despair trying to get his game to work\" style=\"max-width: 500px; margin: auto;\"/></figure>\n\nTo this:\n\n<figure style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content:center; background: var(--lm-white0-black1); border-radius: 3px; padding: 12px\"><img src=\"/public/core/images/notes/game-dev-insider-2.png\" alt=\"Jamie smiling with his fist in the air like a champion\" style=\"max-width: 500px; margin: auto;\"/></figure>\n\n...In a matter of moments!\n\nSo, if any of this has made you feel like giving it a try, please feel free to [apply to the course](https://projectfunction.io/courses/rrtGJAd2ae1e).\n\n\n**P.S.** You can see a small preview of the kind of thing to expect on [itch.io](https://michael-carstairs.itch.io/whale-of-a-time)\n\n",

Some have lost more than others but overall, we all found our \"every day\" lives change drastically in a relatively short span. As optimists, we had envisioned the world going back to pre-pandemic times by October, 2020; when we would be able to resume our teaching as usual. In retrospect, we now know we were very wrong about this!</p>\n\n<p>However, during the long month of March just as Lockdown 1.0 was starting, ProjectFunction came to realize the importance of remote learning, having delivered our courses totally in person as a small team, thus far. This was the point at which we doubled down on our efforts to fulfill our mission of creating a pathway for the marginalized in technology.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, we began working on a new website which would better position PF for this - pardon the cliche - new normal. A new website was also a great opportunity for us to fill in the blanks with information that was missing from the current site and fully migrate to Node.js as a platform of choice for its stability and long-term maintainability.</p>\n\nDesign-wise, we needed to find a design that reflected PF expanding upon its history of working with the wonderful tech community of Nottingham, to now be driven by that community. PF outgrew the previous website designs, thus feeling outdated too quickly; this time, we focused on creating a more complete, timeless design that could grow as we do.\n\n<figure>\n            <img src=\"/public/core/images/figma_collab.jpg\" alt=\"The assistant feature of ScratchPad\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>We used Figma's collaborative functionality to, for the 1st time, remotely design though miles apart.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe started development on the external site, building it upon the same framework we used for our internal learning site Campus. 300+ commits later, we were ready to lift the covers of PFV3.",

		"content": "Thank you all for pledging to support us. Without your support, ProjectFunction would not be able to accomplish our mission of helping the under-represented & marginalised get into tech.\n\nAs you‚Äôre all aware, the pandemic has brought about changes within the industry. Some people have started working remotely, and many others have been furloughed. Companies who have the capacity and flexibility to move to remote setup have done so smoothly, whilst those who have been put on furlough have found themselves with more free time.\n\nMeanwhile, ProjectFunction has paused all courses to ensure the safety of its instructors and learners. We‚Äôve also opted-out of running remote courses as it would mean that those without sufficient access to the internet and/or equipment, would not be able to to participate. However, this does not mean that ProjectFunction has gone into hibernation ‚Äî quite the contrary; our focus has been looking at ways to best use our position, influence, experience, and connections, to enhance the project overall. As a result, we have come up with bigger goals that could help improve the situation for many, by making the course more accessible.\n\nWith this in mind, our Team has grown to align with these growing goals. We have refined our team structures to include a dedicated communications officer, and an advisor. Additionally, we have briefed all team members on the upcoming plans and our new goals for the year. In doing this, every team member is able to focus on a specific aspect within ProjectFunction, allowing us to continue to work towards our overall mission, and enabling us to focus on new projects that further improve ProjectFunction and Nottingham as a whole.\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>AccessForAll Programme:</strong>\n\nWhile our mission remains the same; to help the under-represented and marginalised get into tech, we have defined some immediate and long-term goals that we are confident would have a positive impact on the tech community. Our biggest focus for this year is to make our courses even more accessible through the introduction of our AccessForAll programme. \n\n<figure><img src=\"/public/core/images/accessForAll.gif\" alt=\"AccessForAll\"></figure>\n\nThis programme will enable us to purchase resources for our learners to ensure that anyone who wants to take part in our courses can do so, even if they do not have access to the internet, or their own computers. Over the last few iterations of ProjectFunction, there has been a clear pattern that we have seen; around 30% of the learners who joined ProjectFunction either didn‚Äôt have access to a laptop, or had to borrow ones from the university library. \n\nThis meant that they had difficulties due to not having administrative rights to install the required software. As ProjectFunction continues to grow, it is important for us to focus on making our courses more accessible to those without the necessary equipment. \n\nThe AccessForAll programme will focus on providing learners who need equipment with the following:\n\n<ul class=\"clean-para mini\">\n    <li>A Windows 10 Laptop</li>\n    <li>An Internet dongle</li>\n    <li>A mouse</li>\n</ul>\n\nTo do this, ProjectFunction plans to raise over ¬£5000 to buy the necessary equipment, and to make sure that each learner is not hindered from participating in our courses. \n\nWe believe that all learners, regardless of their race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or financial position, should have access to the resources they need to take part in our courses, so that no learner is disadvantaged or discouraged from taking part.\n\nThe aim is to start our next course (4th wave) by October, 2020. Even if the pandemic situation prevents us from running them in person, we will be better equipped to run remote courses as needed. While we prefer delivering courses in person, we are equally preparing to deliver our next course remotely if current circumstances persist, to ensure everyone has access.\n\nOnce we reach this target, we will start to direct our focus at finding a permanent home for ProjectFunction in Nottingham. Currently, and for the past 2 years, we have been located at NTU. However, this proved to be challenging at times, as we were limited by the university‚Äôs closing times, and occasional double bookings. This meant that learners would often find themselves lost trying to find the new room, or find themselves unable to access certain parts of the building where the course was being run. This was especially the case for learners who were not NTU students and had no student card access into the facility.\n\nFrom our research of centrally-located, meeting spaces in Nottingham that meet the accessibility and size requirements to run our courses, it will cost us around ¬£500 per month to find a suitable home for ProjectFunction where we can host our sessions for our learners.\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>How you can help:</strong>\n\nYou can amplify our message and help us fulfil our mission to reach further corners by spreading our messages within the companies you work at (especially senior leadership), the friends you have (and the friends they have and onwards), and the people you think would benefit from our courses. It will take more than support from the people we directly know, to make this happen. \n\nWe have set up a few ways in which you can help us in this endeavour. \n\n<ol class=\"clean-para mini\">\n    <li>If you are able to make a longer term commitment through a recurring pledge to support our work, you can become a patron by visiting our Patreon page (if you are already a patron, refer your friend to sign up!).</li>\n    <li>Alternatively, if you (or your friends) are unable to make monthly donations but would still like to help us make a difference, we have one-off sponsorship packs available for purchase. </li>\n    <li>If you could convince your company to support us, there are larger sponsorship opportunities available. Please contact us at\n        <a href=\"mailto:sponsor@projectfunction.io\">sponsor@projectfunction.io</a> </li>\n    <li>We also accept sponsorship in-kind. If you feel you or your company could help us reach our goals, get in touch with us at\n        <a href=\"mailto:partnership@projectfunction.io\">partnership@projectfunction.io</a></li>\n    <li>If you are personally unable to financially support us, but would still like to help us make a bigger impact, retweet our tweets, share our posts, and spread the word!</li>\n</ol>\n\nOnce you are on board, spread the word; tell your family and friends about ProjectFunction and what we do, and let them know how they can support us too. If each one of you could persuade two people to sign up by becoming a patron or sponsor, and they did the same, we would reach our goal in next to no time.\n\nWe are available on the following platforms:\n\nTwitter: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pfnotts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/pfnotts</a><br>\nLinkedIn: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/projectfunction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/projectfunction</a><br>\nFacebook: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://facebook.com/ProjectFunction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://facebook.com/ProjectFunction</a><br>\nInstagram: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pfnotts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/pfnotts</a><br>\n",

		"content": "This week, we had our last session for wave3, and even though I was confident we had achieved success in delivering the course, I underestimated how successful and how much of an impact this wave had made. As mentioned in our documentation on delivery structure; we had decided to change the way we deliver our sessions to our learners. This was done to ensure that more emphasis is placed on communication and collaboration, so that the courses better represent the industry.\n\nOver the past 8 weeks, our learners have been introduced to the web, from a developer point of view; looking at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the background of web technologies. After some theory into why and how it came about, the learners had the chance to try out HTML and CSS for the first time. Once they were confident, we moved on to the basics of programming, then JavaScript. Over the course of 5 weeks, our learners attempted over 10 tasks related to structuring, styling, and interacting with web-pages, and as each week went by, they became more and more confident. üí™ During this, they were introduced to tools like slack (for communication), and GitHub. By the end of week 5, our learners became familiar with the basics of versioning, and cross team communication. By this time, it was clear that they were ready to apply those skills and start collaborating.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GKpEfkvdC1MdBYDLNZnVgPH1DWzvbX_9\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PFWave 3\"/></figure>\n\nWe started off this week‚Äôs session by giving the learners a chance to finish off their [#PFProject](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PFProject?src=hashtag), which they had been working on for the past 4 weeks, making use of everything they picked up during their time at ProjectFunction. Once our weekly dose of pizza arrived, we had a break ??. During this break, learners working on different projects started talking to each-other; some spoke about their life outside of PF, whilst others discussed their projects and prepared for their demos. It was such a heart-warming scene. üíô\n\nOnce our break was over, we prepped for the learners to demo, and when I asked who was willing to demo first, everyone was keen to go first - they were all excited to showcase what they had done and what they had learned.\n\nAfter a discussion amongst themselves, team Orang opted to go first and demoed their Nottingham Tourism Hub website which they had created all by themselves. Their website featured the top spots in Nottingham, as well as the rating of each spot‚Ä¶ in ducks. After seeing what they had created in just five days as a team, I felt so happy - It was clear that ProjectFunction was working, and what we were doing actually had a great impact. Plus, the learners involved met new people, and had fun along the way.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xc_JKdKb6A0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nNext, we had Hana come up and demo her personal portfolio which featured her skills, links to her social media, as well as a timeline of her experiences so far. It was great to see her take the basic web development skills and bring it to a whole new level by creating something that would represent her online. When I initially spoke to Hana about her demo, she told me that there was not much to show and that her presentation would only last a few seconds. However, once she was in front of the class demoing away, she really got into the presentation and gave us some insight into her project.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BRBnhvFZHo0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAnd finally, we had team AB close off the demo by showcasing their digital Art Gallery website, a creation which took them just a few days to create. Despite the fact that the members of this team had missed some weeks of ProjectFunction, they were able to take what they could and created a responsive website containing images, as well as a comment section.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-MvWC6-O30M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWhen the demo was over, it was time to hand out certificates to our learners for successfully completing their course with ProjectFunction. Additionally, the top three learners who had highest engagement ratings throughout the wave received their prizes.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1n_LOhDGUZ4oGevHQ5U0Hmc4MsZ7pSgt6\" alt=\"Learners with highest engagement\" loading=\"lazy\"/></figure>\n\nThe learners were so proud of what they had achieved, and we were even prouder after seeing them take what we provided, and created something. Additionally, gaining some collaboration skills, GitHub skills, and communication skills along the way. We look forward to the next wave of learners, and can‚Äôt wait to see this cohort again for our traditional end-of-wave [#PFMeal](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PFMeal?src=hashtag)\n\n_You can [check out](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17J-MOjPJ_yYkmrNWKKF9_fJ-SW9vsw1P?usp=sharing) the images and videos from the last session of wave 3._\n",
