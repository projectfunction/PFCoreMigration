					After 4 years, 7 waves, 9 notes, 25 backers, 78 sessions, 90 Learners, and an uncountable number of
					community supporters, this marks the end of a wonderful era for ProjectFunction.
					This bitter-sweet post will be the last from ProjectFunction as you know it. It outlines how we got
					here, why the temporary preservation is necessary, and most importantly what it means for the
					community going forward.
